      "content": "A  purely   peer-to-peer   version   of   electronic   cash   would   allow   online \npayments   to   be   sent   directly   from   one   party   to   another   without   going   through   a \nfinancial institution.   Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main \nbenefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. \nWe propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. \nThe   network   timestamps   transactions   by   hashing   them   into   an   ongoing   chain   of \nhash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing \nthe proof-of-work.   The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of \nevents witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power.   As \nlong as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to \nattack the network,  they'll  generate the  longest  chain  and  outpace attackers.   The \nnetwork itself requires minimal structure.   Messages are broadcast on a best effort \nbasis,   and   nodes   can   leave   and   rejoin   the   network   at   will,   accepting   the   longest \nproof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone."

      "title": "1.Introduction",
      "content": "Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as \ntrusted third  parties  to process electronic payments.   While the  system works  well enough for \nmost   transactions,   it   still   suffers   from   the   inherent   weaknesses   of   the   trust   based   model. \nCompletely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot \navoid   mediating   disputes.     The   cost   of   mediation   increases   transaction   costs,   limiting   the \nminimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions, \nand   there   is   a   broader   cost   in   the   loss   of   ability   to   make   non-reversible   payments   for   non-\nreversible services.  With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads.  Merchants must \nbe wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need. \nA certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable.  These costs and payment uncertainties \ncan be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments \nover a communications channel without a trusted party.\nWhat is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, \nallowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted \nthird  party.    Transactions  that  are  computationally  impractical  to   reverse   would  protect  sellers \nfrom fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect buyers.   In \nthis paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed \ntimestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions.  The \nsystem   is   secure   as   long   as   honest   nodes   collectively   control   more   CPU   power   than   any \ncooperating group of attacker nodes.\n1"

      "title": "2.Transactions",
      "content": "We define an electronic coin as a chain of digital signatures.  Each owner transfers the coin to the \nnext by digitally signing a hash of the previous transaction and the public key of the next owner \nand adding these to the end of the coin.  A payee can verify the signatures to verify the chain of \nownership.\nThe problem of course is the payee can't verify that one of the owners did not double-spend \nthe coin.  A common solution is to introduce a trusted central authority, or mint, that checks every \ntransaction for double spending.  After each transaction, the coin must be returned to the mint to \nissue a new coin, and only coins issued directly from the mint are trusted not to be double-spent. \nThe   problem   with   this   solution   is   that   the   fate   of   the   entire   money   system   depends   on   the \ncompany running the mint, with every transaction having to go through them, just like a bank.\nWe   need   a   way   for   the   payee   to   know   that   the   previous   owners   did   not   sign   any   earlier \ntransactions.   For our purposes, the earliest transaction is the one that counts, so we don't care \nabout later attempts to double-spend.  The only way to confirm the absence of a transaction is to \nbe aware of all transactions.  In the mint based model, the mint was aware of all transactions and \ndecided   which   arrived   first.    To  accomplish   this   without   a   trusted   party,   transactions   must   be \npublicly announced [1], and we need a system for participants to agree on a single history of the \norder in which they were received.  The payee needs proof that at the time of each transaction, the \nmajority of nodes agreed it was the first received."

A timestamp server works by taking a \nhash   of   a   block   of   items   to   be   timestamped   and   widely   publishing   the   hash,   such   as   in   a \nnewspaper or Usenet post [2-5].   The timestamp proves that the data must have existed at the \ntime, obviously, in order to get into the hash.  Each timestamp includes the previous timestamp in \nits hash, forming a chain, with each additional timestamp reinforcing the ones before it.\n2\nBlock\nItemItem...\nHash\nBlock\nItemItem...\nHash\nTransaction\nOwner 1's\nPublic Key\nOwner 0's\nSignature\nHash\nTransaction\nOwner 2's\nPublic Key\nOwner 1's\nSignature\nHash\n \nVerify\nTransaction\nOwner 3's\nPublic Key\nOwner 2's\nSignature\nHash\n \nVerify\nOwner 2's\nPrivate Key\nOwner 1's\nPrivate Key\nSign  Sign  \nOwner 3's\nPrivate Key"

      "content": "To implement a distributed timestamp server on a peer-to-peer basis, we will need to use a proof-\nof-work system  similar to Adam  Back's  Hashcash  [6],  rather than  newspaper  or  Usenet  posts. \nThe proof-of-work involves scanning for a value that when hashed, such as with SHA-256, the \nhash begins with a number of zero bits.  The average work required is exponential in the number \nof zero bits required and can be verified by executing a single hash.\nFor our timestamp network, we implement the proof-of-work by incrementing a nonce in the \nblock until a value is found that gives the block's hash the required zero bits.   Once the CPU \neffort   has   been   expended   to   make   it   satisfy   the   proof-of-work,   the   block   cannot   be   changed \nwithout  redoing  the   work.    As   later   blocks   are  chained   after  it,   the  work  to  change  the  block \nwould include redoing all the blocks after it.\nThe proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision \nmaking.  If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone \nable   to   allocate   many   IPs.     Proof-of-work   is   essentially   one-CPU-one-vote.     The   majority \ndecision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested \nin it.  If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the \nfastest and outpace any competing chains.   To modify a past block, an attacker would have to \nredo the proof-of-work of the block and all blocks after it and then catch up with and surpass the \nwork of the honest nodes.  We will show later that the probability of a slower attacker catching up \ndiminishes exponentially as subsequent blocks are added.\nTo compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest in running nodes over time, \nthe proof-of-work difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number of \nblocks per hour.  If they're generated too fast, the difficulty increases."

      "content": "The steps to run the network are as follows:\n1)New transactions are broadcast to all nodes.\n2)Each node collects new transactions into a block.  \n3)Each node works on finding a difficult proof-of-work for its block.\n4)When a node finds a proof-of-work, it broadcasts the block to all nodes.\n5)Nodes accept the block only if all transactions in it are valid and not already spent.\n6)Nodes express their acceptance of the block by working on creating the next block in the \nchain, using the hash of the accepted block as the previous hash.\nNodes   always   consider   the   longest   chain   to   be   the   correct   one   and   will   keep   working   on \nextending it.   If two nodes broadcast different versions of the next block simultaneously, some \nnodes may receive one or the other first.  In that case, they work on the first one they received, \nbut save the other branch in case it becomes longer.  The tie will be broken when the next proof-\nof-work   is   found   and   one   branch   becomes   longer;   the   nodes   that   were   working   on   the   other \nbranch will then switch to the longer one.\n3\nBlock\nPrev HashNonce\nTxTx...\nBlock\nPrev HashNonce\nTxTx...\n\nNew transaction broadcasts do not necessarily need to reach all nodes.

      "title": "6.Incentive",
      "content": "By convention, the first transaction in a block is a special transaction that starts a new coin owned \nby the creator of the block.  This adds an incentive for nodes to support the network, and provides \na way to initially distribute coins into circulation, since there is no central authority to issue them. \nThe steady addition of a constant of amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending \nresources to add gold to circulation.  In our case, it is CPU time and electricity that is expended.\nThe incentive can also be funded with transaction fees.  If the output value of a transaction is \nless than its input value, the difference is a transaction fee that is added to the incentive value of \nthe   block   containing   the   transaction.     Once   a   predetermined   number   of   coins   have   entered \ncirculation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation \nfree.\nThe   incentive   may   help   encourage   nodes   to   stay   honest.     If   a   greedy   attacker   is   able   to \nassemble more CPU power than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it \nto defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins.  He ought to \nfind it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than \neveryone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth."

A user only needs to keep \na copy of the block headers of the longest proof-of-work chain, which he can get by querying \nnetwork   nodes   until   he's   convinced   he   has   the   longest   chain,   and   obtain   the   Merkle   branch \nlinking   the   transaction   to   the   block   it's   timestamped   in.     He   can't   check   the   transaction   for \nhimself, but by linking it to a place in the chain, he can see that a network node has accepted it, \nand blocks added after it further confirm the network has accepted it.\nAs such, the verification is reliable as long as honest nodes control the network, but is more \nvulnerable   if   the   network   is   overpowered   by   an   attacker.     While   network   nodes   can   verify \ntransactions   for   themselves,   the   simplified   method   can   be   fooled   by   an   attacker's   fabricated \ntransactions for as long as the attacker can continue to overpower the network.   One strategy to \nprotect against this would be to accept alerts from network nodes when they detect an invalid \nblock,   prompting   the   user's   software   to   download   the   full   block   and   alerted   transactions   to \nconfirm the inconsistency.

To   allow   value   to   be   split   and   combined, \ntransactions  contain  multiple  inputs  and  outputs.    Normally  there will  be either  a  single  input \nfrom a larger previous transaction or multiple inputs combining smaller amounts, and at most two \noutputs: one for the payment, and one returning the change, if any, back to the sender.  \nIt should be noted that fan-out, where a transaction depends on several transactions, and those \ntransactions depend on many more, is not a problem here.

Even if this is accomplished, it does not throw the system open to arbitrary changes, such \nas creating value out of thin air or taking money that never belonged to the attacker.  Nodes are \nnot going to accept an invalid transaction as payment, and honest nodes will never accept a block \ncontaining them.   An attacker can only try to change one of his own transactions to take back \nmoney he recently spent.\nThe race between the honest chain and an attacker chain can be characterized as a Binomial \nRandom Walk.  The success event is the honest chain being extended by one block, increasing its \nlead by +1, and the failure event is the attacker's chain being extended by one block, reducing the \ngap by -1.\nThe probability of an attacker catching up from a given deficit is analogous to a Gambler's \nRuin problem.  Suppose a gambler with unlimited credit starts at a deficit and plays potentially an \ninfinite   number   of   trials   to   try   to   reach   breakeven.    We   can   calculate   the   probability   he   ever \nreaches breakeven, or that an attacker ever catches up with the honest chain, as follows [8]:\np = probability an honest node finds the next block\nq = probability the attacker finds the next block\nq\nz\n = probability the attacker will ever catch up from z blocks behind\nq\nz\n=\n{\n1ifp≤q\nq/p\nz\nifpq\n}\n6\nIdentitiesTransactions\nTrusted\nThird Party\nCounterpartyPublic\nIdentitiesTransactionsPublic\nNew Privacy Model\nTraditional Privacy Model\n\nGiven our assumption that p > q, the probability drops exponentially as the number of blocks the \nattacker has to catch up with increases.   With the odds against him, if he doesn't make a lucky \nlunge forward early on, his chances become vanishingly small as he falls further behind.\nWe   now   consider   how   long   the   recipient   of  a   new   transaction   needs   to   wait   before   being \nsufficiently certain the sender can't change the transaction.  We assume the sender is an attacker \nwho wants to make the recipient believe he paid him for a while, then switch it to pay back to \nhimself  after   some   time   has   passed.    The   receiver   will   be   alerted   when   that   happens,   but   the \nsender hopes it will be too late.\nThe receiver generates a new key pair and gives the public key to the sender shortly before \nsigning.  This prevents the sender from preparing a chain of blocks ahead of time by working on \nit continuously until he is lucky enough to get far enough ahead, then executing the transaction at \nthat  moment.   Once  the transaction is   sent,  the dishonest  sender starts  working  in  secret on  a \nparallel chain containing an alternate version of his transaction.\nThe recipient waits until the transaction has been added to a block and  z  blocks have been \nlinked   after   it.     He   doesn't   know   the   exact   amount   of   progress   the   attacker   has   made,   but \nassuming   the   honest   blocks   took   the   average   expected   time   per   block,   the   attacker's   potential \nprogress will be a Poisson distribution with expected value:\n=z\nq\np\nTo get the probability the attacker could still catch up now, we multiply the Poisson density for \neach amount of progress he could have made by the probability he could catch up from that point:\n∑\nk=0\n∞\n\nk\ne\n−\nk!\n⋅\n{\nq/p\nz−k\nifk≤z\n1ifkz\n}\nRearranging to avoid summing the infinite tail of the distribution...\n1−\n∑\nk=0\nz\n\nk\ne\n−\nk!\n1−q/p\nz−k\n\nConverting to C code...\n#include <math.h>\ndouble AttackerSuccessProbability(double q, int z)\n{\n    double p = 1.0 - q;\n    double lambda = z * (q / p);\n    double sum = 1.0;\n    int i, k;\n    for (k = 0; k <= z; k++)\n    {\n        double poisson = exp(-lambda);\n        for (i = 1; i <= k; i++)\n            poisson *= lambda / i;\n        sum -= poisson * (1 - pow(q / p, z - k));\n    }\n    return sum;\n}\n7\n\nRunning some results, we can see the probability drop off exponentially with z.\nq=0.1\nz=0    P=1.0000000\nz=1    P=0.2045873\nz=2    P=0.0509779\nz=3    P=0.0131722\nz=4    P=0.0034552\nz=5    P=0.0009137\nz=6    P=0.0002428\nz=7    P=0.0000647\nz=8    P=0.0000173\nz=9    P=0.0000046\nz=10   P=0.0000012\nq=0.3\nz=0    P=1.0000000\nz=5    P=0.1773523\nz=10   P=0.0416605\nz=15   P=0.0101008\nz=20   P=0.0024804\nz=25   P=0.0006132\nz=30   P=0.0001522\nz=35   P=0.0000379\nz=40   P=0.0000095\nz=45   P=0.0000024\nz=50   P=0.0000006\nSolving for P less than 0.1%...\nP < 0.001\nq=0.10   z=5\nq=0.15   z=8\nq=0.20   z=11\nq=0.25   z=15\nq=0.30   z=24\nq=0.35   z=41\nq=0.40   z=89\nq=0.45   z=340"

The network is robust in its unstructured simplicity.   Nodes \nwork all at once with little coordination.   They do not need to be identified, since messages are \nnot routed to any particular place and only need to be delivered on a best effort basis.  Nodes can \nleave   and   rejoin   the   network   at   will,   accepting   the   proof-of-work   chain   as   proof   of   what \nhappened while they were gone.
